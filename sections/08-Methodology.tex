\section{Evaluation of RX, LRX and ACAD }
\label{sec:MATLAB_methodology}
To evaluate the performance of the ADs considered in this task, models of the algorithms were developed in MATLAB, and tested on hyperspectral image data from the Cuprite site \cite{Cuprite_data} taken by NASA's AVIRIS hyperspectral imager. MATLAB hyperspectral toolbox \cite{MATLAB_hyperspectral_toolbox} was used for image preprocessing, visualization and for having a good starting point for developing further functionality. The toolbox included an implementation of the RX algorithm. A fork of the toolbox was made, available at \cite{MATLAB_hyperspectral_toolbox_fork}, to be able to do MATLAB implementations of ACAD and LRX. The most important scripts and functions from the forked toolbox are also located in appendix \ref{appendice:MATLAB_hyperspectral}.
