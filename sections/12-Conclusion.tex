\section{Future work}

\subsection{Optimizations}

All BRAMs used in the correlation module could have its content initialized to zero. This could help simplify the control of the correlation module.

\\ 
Evaluate the value $\tau$ based on experimental results.\\

Inverse computation; use Matrix Inversion Lemma as proposed by Hsueh in \cite{hsueh_master_thesis}.\\

Power optimizations; clock enable signals for modules.\\

Precision LUT approach must be checked!\\

Verificiation!!!
