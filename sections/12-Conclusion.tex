\section{Future work}

\subsection{Optimizations}
Number of BRAM -rows in acad correlation can be increased to increase update and increase throughput. Tradeoff of resources available and throughput.
\\

All BRAMs used in the correlation module could have its content initialized to zero. This could help simplify the control of the correlation module.
