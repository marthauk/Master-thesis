This thesis is submitted to the department of Electronics Systems at NTNU as part of the Master of Science degree in Electronics, with specialization in digital circuit design. The project is part of the SmallSat project at NTNU, a resarch project at NTNU which is focused on the design and creation of small satellites. The mission objectives of the SmallSat project is to "provide and support ocean color mapping through a Hyperspectral Imager payload, autonomously processed data, and on-demand autonomous communications in a concert of robotic agents at the Norwegian coast". The thesis was started on in the mid of January. 
\\

The purpose of this thesis is to propose a design of an Anomaly detector in hardware, to be implemented on a Zynq 7000-device, used by the SmallSat project.
