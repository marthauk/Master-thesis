This thesis is submitted to the department of Electronics Systems at NTNU as part of the Master of Science degree in Electronics, with specialization in digital circuit design. The project is part of the SmallSat project at NTNU, a resarch project at NTNU which is focused on the design and creation of small satellites. The project was started on in the mid of January. 
\\

The purpose of this thesis is to design an Anomaly detector in hardware, to be implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate array.
